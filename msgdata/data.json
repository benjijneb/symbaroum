The change means that shields no longer needs a +1 in the bonus field. <h2>Make a backup</h2> See <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmbxMmqNNXU' >Foundry tutorial for backups</a><br /><br/> If you have questions and/or need help, ping us on either on #symbaroum-vtt-foundry on Davokar Explorers Discord or the #free-league channel on Foundry discord."
