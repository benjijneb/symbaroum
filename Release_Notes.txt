Version 2.15.0
Thanks to @Bithir :
Text alterations to avoid "Is Active" for abilities/traits/mystical abilities as it confuses people with Core book term "Active" - instead use "Learned" (abilities, mystical powers) or "Acquired" (traits)

Allowance for bonus on max corruption (as is in the case of Strong gift)
Experience - for rebated abilities/boons/burdens
Alternative sheet has support for:

Added a field 'number' on equipment and weapons, in order to keep track of consumables.

See page 179 of the core rulebook for further details. 

Thanks to @khaali#8262:
